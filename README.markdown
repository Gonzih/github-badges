Github Badges
-------------

Want to show off your projects on github to world? 
Then a sexy badge on your blog would be awesome.

Its still under development, but here is a screenshot
of the unit tests + the sample badge below.

<div><a href="http://skitch.com/drnic/keqx/github-badge-new-look-n-feel"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080426-jisygbfprs2wntu7fnngs1f7wm.jpg" alt="github badge: new look-n-feel" /></a></div>

Usage
=====

It is expected that to use the widget, you will copy + paste + modify
the following snippet into your blog sidebar.

    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
      GITHUB_USERNAME="drnic";
    </script>
    <script src="dist/github-badge-launcher.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
